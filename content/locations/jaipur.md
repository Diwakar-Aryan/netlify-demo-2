Our collaboration extends to Abdul Sattar Kharadi, who hosts block carving workshops at his studio. He proudly carries forward a rich tradition of block carvers that spans nearly three centuries. During the inception of Jaipur, his forebears were resettled from Sanganer to Purani Basti. Eventually, he relocated to his present studio, situated in close proximity to Albert Hall. Within his community, the craft of block carving is held in high esteem, emphasizing the pursuit of excellence through the creation of blocks known for their exceptional quality.
