During the global COVID lockdowns when travel and in-person gatherings were restricted, we initiated virtual adaptations of our workshops. This innovative approach to crafting has captured our attention, and we are dedicated to enhancing its sophistication. Our primary objective remains consistent in both virtual and physical versions â€“ to maintain a personalized and engaging experience.

In the virtual workshops, upon enrollment, we dispatch a comprehensive dye-kit containing all the necessary ingredients and detailed instructions to your doorstep. To ensure you achieve the desired results and to foster a sense of inclusion, we complement this kit with daily online personal sessions led by experienced instructors. This approach allows you to fully participate and engage, even from a distance, preserving the essence of our craft workshops.
