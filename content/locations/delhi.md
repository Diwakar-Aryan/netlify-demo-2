We have established a collaborative partnership with SSMI, a Delhi-based NGO dedicated to the promotion of Fine Arts & Crafts. Together, we work towards organizing workshops centered around natural dyeing and block printing. SSMI is deeply committed to enhancing the quality of life for marginalized women, youth, and children in Delhi and its surrounding areas. They are fervently dedicated to enabling and empowering these individuals to unlock their full potential. Notably, SSMI operates a women-led block printing division, which independently conducts workshops as well.
