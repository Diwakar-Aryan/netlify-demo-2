 <blockquote> 
  <p>Bagru, a small village town in Rajasthan, is situated at a distance of 32 kms. south-west of Jaipur city. Its traditional processes of hand block printing on textiles with rich natural colors have been known for many centuries. With the attraction of foreign buyers for the traditional hand printed textiles, this village hums with much activity today, supplying exquisite printed materials for the export trade.</p>
  <p>The hand printers, known as chhipas, came from Sawai Madhopur, Alwar, Jhunjhunu and Sikkar districts of Rajasthan to settle in Bagru and make it their home some 300 years ago. According to a legend, at the very outset, some two families of chhipas were brought by the Thakur of Bagru to settle in Bagru from Isarda, a village four miles from Jaipur and from then on migration of more families of chhipas continued from different places.</blockquote>
