blurb: "Block Printing, the very word calls up myriad visual images: earthy
  colored printed textiles drying under the sun, artisans nurturing traditional
  skills, communities living in harmony with nature. Yet these alluring
  depictions barely scratch the surface. Only repeated examinations can enable
  one to comprehend the intricate logic and wisdom behind the almost mysterious
  traditional virtuosity."
