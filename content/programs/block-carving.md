blurb: Transforming a rigid form into an expression of thoughts and imagination
  is a work of art. This time-honored and admirable skill is a matter of
  technique, patience, and much technical practice. The accumulation of these
  virtues evolve into a continuity of cultural inheritance and identity, among
  traditional family of block carvers.
