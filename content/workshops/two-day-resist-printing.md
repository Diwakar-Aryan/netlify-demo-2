Resist. Because it is - the process of undoing, one is separated into two. Mud or wax, when manifested on cloth, creates spaces - positive and negative. Meandering between the opposites, we sought to reclaim the synthesis of the (seemingly) two into one holistic gesture of doing - inside and outside.
