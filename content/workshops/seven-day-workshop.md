blurb: More number of days means more colors. Prepare dye extracts from real
  dye-stuffs, understand the effects of water quality, pH and decode traditional
  scouring methods. Use flowers, barks, roots, insect dyes to dye protein and
  cellulose fibres. Set up a natural Indigo fermentation vat and make printing
  inks and mud resist paste. Learn woodblock making techniques and traditional,
  modern dyeing methods with one-to-one mentoring.

So much of what propels our pursuit of beauty stems from the invisible connection between nature and labor, realized only with time. Experience of working in the crafts for six consecutive days will reveal new insights into the alchemy of multiple pre-industrial processes; aided by organic and plant produce.

We are delighted to host enthusiasts seeking to create a color palette of their own with direct and compound dyes.
