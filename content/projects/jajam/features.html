                        Beginning 2015, Our Journey resembles a treasure hunt across Rajasthan!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        En route on the journey, we found clues, met guides & discovered villages in our quest to
                        understand the nuances of traditional block printing. We listened to stories and memories of
                        master printers and dyers. These interactions revealed to us an invisible thread knitting Indian
                        communities, cultures, beliefs & skills, and the Jajam embodied them all as a ‘Community
                        textile’. How beautiful that a Jajam opens up its generous heart and welcomes people from all
                        sections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We wonder where are today’s Jajam.

            <p>
                Urbanisation has slowly chipped away at the social fabric of local community life and, today, the
                craft of jajam making has lost its patrons and appreciators. Since the mid-20th century demand has
                slowly diminished, with only a handful of printers retaining the skills, resources and resolve to
                continue. In an attempt to keep up with changing times, many chhipa printers crossed over to
                inexpensive chemical dyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent years, a culture of consumerism and competition has taken over and the sense of community
                living has dissolved. Societies that once gathered together, making collective decisions and
                celebrating festivals, have all but disappeared. The art of dyeing and printing has also started to
                be affected. Deforestation within India’s jungles means it is more and more difficult to source
                natural ingredients. Traditional dyeing and washing processes are an increasingly rare sight as
                rivers run dry.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the Dablana (South East Rajasthan) Jajam exhibited here, the red dye flows into many areas. Printers
                would frequent Mej river banks for washing and achieving clarity in their natural dyes, especially while
                handling large textiles. As the river perished, so did the stories of craft in these printing villages.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Jajam owes its innovative designs to the traditions that brought them to life. Printed on thick
                    hand-woven cotton fabric, they often featured motifs from local architectural designs and would also
                    celebrate the rich wildlife of a region. Tigers, elephants, soldiers, or mounted warriors might
                    surround the stacked geometric designs of the central field like symbolic protective figures to
                    create a safe space in which people played chaupad and conversed.

                    <p>
                        Tales of Chaupad are inextricably woven into Indian mythology and folklore. It’s not common
                        knowledge that our modern favourites like Ludo and Chess originated from the ancient Indian game
                        of Chaupad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The chaupad motif was often block printed in the center of a jajam where two to four players
                        could enjoy throwing the dice and racing their pawns around a four-arm path. Thus jajam created
                        an entertaining gathering spot during a village council meeting. While the game no longer
                        features in modern village life, references to it and reminiscences are still embedded in Indian
                        culture.

                <p>
                    The labour-intensive nature of block printed fabric requires a community of artisans — chhipas
                    printers, rangrez dyers, dhobis washer men and block carvers. Jajam making reflected the pinnacle of
                    craft practices of chhippa block printers. These artisan communities were usually nestled alongside
                    rivers where the deep red and black hues of the natural dyes would be washed in the free-flowing
                    stream.

                            History mirrors the significance of jajam as a token of camaraderie within various
                            communities such as Rao, Rajput, and others.

                <p>
                    Surrounded by multiple border and complex centerfield designs, jajam making required a wide
                    repertoire of blocks. The richness of the seasoned wood with the skills of the Kharadi (wood carver)
                    community contributed to a sharper image in the print that would outlast the cheaper alternatives
                    that eventually flooded the market.

                            350 years ago. During the development of Jaipur, his ancestors were relocated to Purani
                            Basti. The craft held dear by his community focused on finesse achieved through blocks made
                            of a superior quality.

                    A craftsman translates designs in his mind with impeccable hand-eye coordination. Jajam is an
                    outcome of the invaluable contribution of several craftspeople across Rajasthan. Amongst the myriad
                    of craftsmen, below is an assemblage of block printers and makers who helped us rediscover this art
                    form.

                        Prints. His Jajam prints and Sodiya has garnered him recognition. He vividly remembers his
                        forefathers selling printed Jajam at Hatwada, a weekly bazaar in Jaipur. On our request,
                        Purushottomji’s family printed us traditional Jajam in great enthusiasm.
