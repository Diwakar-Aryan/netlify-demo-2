    In the pre-industrial era, Indiaâ€™s prolific textile industry was virtually
    clothing the world.


    The exceptional proficiency of Indian craftsmen was representative of a unique heritage of creative talent that was specific to their world view. Rooted to their surrounding raw materials and commune of patrons and audiences, their peculiar characteristic of hereditary practices over ages evolved and later enabled them to adapt to the changes in demand of new markets far away from home.

      research techniques usage and processes solidified and deepened our
      understanding of what goes on to create such works and how things have
      changed over time.
