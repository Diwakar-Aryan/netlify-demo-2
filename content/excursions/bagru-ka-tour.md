    As an outside viewer, we were engulfed with the sensation of awe and humility when confronted by—the diversity in skills of artisans, the vast vocabularies of patterns and motifs, and the sheer large scale of production capacities. All of it at one place—Bagru.

    We loved that feeling.

    We took the conscious decision to co
    ntextually interpret this complex network of craftspeople rooted in their surroundings and traditions yet dynamically influenced by new global stimulus—climate, economic, scientific, social, political.

    You perceive that you do not know anything about the neighbourhood but, at the same time, you understand the emotion they are evoking. Your senses are enliven and you fill the gaps of the story in your head. You are a part of the story that you are experiencing.

    All is one.

    We want you to face this story the same way we did years ago, as if he/she is immersing in a series of live performances in a living museum.
