We have created a series of workshops, where we delve into the nuances of 'how to' in natural dyes, pastes and other craft practices. Our workshop is for anyone (beginner or expert) who wants to learn about crafts processes. 

If you have the time, we have the space. Join us in exploring this wonderful world.
