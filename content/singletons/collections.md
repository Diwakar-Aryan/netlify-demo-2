At our block printing and natural dye unit in Bagru, Rajasthan; we are not only re-making Jajam in its traditional form but also adapting the classic motifs and patterns into our contemporary collection of home furnishings. Each of our fabric has gone through various steps of indigenous way of pre-treatment to ensure a good color absorption capacity and longevity of the fabric. 

Like Jajam textiles, the collection showcases red and black – two elusive colors, made from alizarin and iron filings respectively.
