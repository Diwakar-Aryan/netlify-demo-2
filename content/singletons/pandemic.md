title: Breathe Easy
---
The countryside location of our studio has been designed with natural ventilation in mind, with large windows and doors that allow the breeze to flow through.

The design prioritizes open spaces for people can move around and socialize freely without feeling confined. The pockets of privacy and community provide a sense of security and belonging. The studio embraces industrial style and leaves essential elements and services exposed, albeit neatly arranged, providing easy access for maintenance.</p>
